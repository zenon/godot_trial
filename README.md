# Just playing

Warning 1: This is a playground. If it breaks your computer, I refrain from being responsible. (And in that case I probably broke mine before, thus am short of money to help you.)

Warning 2: It is boring. I'm an absolute beginner, and this thing doesn't do anything interesting. I hope I'll be able to change that though.

This is a [Godot](https://godotengine.org) project. To edit it, download Godot, and open it. To run it, just put the Godot engine into the same directory as the project.godot file, and start it.

- a floor
- "player": a cylinder with a nose (also a cylinder)
- a block that drops from the sky
- steer the player with arrow keys
- if you push the block off the floor, it'll vanish into the abyss
- Tab key brings the camera from somewhere to first person, shift-tab brings it to somewhere again.
