# Just playing

Warning 1: This is a playground. If it breaks your computer, I refrain from being responsible. (And in that case I probably broke mine before, thus am short of money to help you.)

Warning 2: It is boring. I'm an absolute beginner, and this thing doesn't do anything interesting. I hope I'll be able to change that though.

This is a [Godot](https://godotengine.org) project. To edit it, download Godot, and open it. To run it, just put the Godot engine into the same directory as the project.godot file, and start it.
